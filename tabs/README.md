# Tabbed product descriptions

This example is based on the Shopify help center article [Add tabs to product descriptions](https://help.shopify.com/themes/customization/products/add-tabs-to-product-descriptions).

If you follow the article above, you will be adding three tabs to all product pages. In the first tab, you will load up the product description. In the other tabs you will load up the power editor content from the composite fields with the handle “tabs” that you configured above.

Just follow the article and when it is time to “Edit sections/product-template.liquid” use the following liquid code from [snippet.liquid](snippet.liquid).

You can find the code for the same example using twitter’s bootstrap framework in [bootstrap-snippet.liquid](bootstrap-snippet.liquid)
